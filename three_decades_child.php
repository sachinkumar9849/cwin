                        <h1><span>Three Decades of the Child Rights Movement in Nepal</span> </h1>
                        <p class="PT-3">Nepal's child rights movement, initiated with the inception of CWIN-Nepal, has completed three decades. CWIN envisioned a just, prosperous, and inclusive society where all children enjoy the fundamental human rights and where the state takes full responsibility to respect, protect and fulfil these rights. Established in 1987 as the first child rights organization in Nepal by a group of university students actively engaged in the human rights and democratic movements, with the leadership of Mr. Gauri Pradhan, CWIN-Nepal continues to play an active and leading role in the child rights movement in Nepal.
                    </p>
                    <p>CWIN started advocating for the rights of children in Nepal three years before the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). Before the establishment of CWIN, child rights did not assume priority in any policy dialogue and no one raised issues of child protection as a matter of concern or action. With its dedicated efforts, CWIN Nepal has been able to transform child rights from a non-issue to a key element in the national political agenda. CWIN-Nepal put into operation model interventions involving sensitisation, research studies, and discussion with concerned stakeholders for their capacity development and increased conceptual clarity for the promotion of child rights and protection of children at risk. CWIN further advanced the movement by engaging in policy dialogue to bring favourable policies and mechanisms for the betterment of children.</p>
                <p>
After the restoration of democracy in the year 1990 and ratification of the UNCRC by the Government of Nepal, the environment became favourable to advocate and work for rights of children. Gradually more civil society organizations came forward to work on child rights. With increased coordination and partnership with like-minded organizations, the child rights movement in Nepal started accelerating. Networks were formed, and a collective and organized voice on child rights started being heard. As society started realizing that children can be change agents, the children themselves began to organize through child clubs and child rights forums nationwide. Children are now able to demonstrate their agency and play a significant role in the child rights movement.</p>    
<p>The Government of Nepal also began the formulation of progressive laws, policies and programmes on rights of children after the ratification of the UNCRC with inputs from civil society organizations. As a result of these initiatives, Nepal has different acts, policies, plans of action and mechanisms relating to children from local to the national level. What is more, the constitution of Nepal 2015 is very progressive on child rights issues. Policies such as those on Child-Friendly Local Governance and child protection have immensely contributed to the institutionalisation of spaces for children's participation in issues that concern them in Nepal. These policies and actions have led to improved coordination between government line agencies and CSOs. Civil society organisations can now create opportunities to strengthen partnership with the state machinery for implementation of existing policies, laws and regulations and model innovative interventions for replication on a larger scale.</p>              
<p>
During the past three decades, we have faced numerous challenges such as natural disasters, adverse political situations including armed conflict, and criminal activities obstructing children's protection. Despite these adversities, CWIN has never slackened its efforts to defend childrenâ€™s rights. Rather, these spurred CWIN to greater determination 'for children, with children', while maintaining its clean image. Emerging issues were addressed with pioneering and innovative approaches. CWIN believes that it has played a vital role in the process of development and mechanisms and policies in different ways. </p>
<p>
For instance, during the period of armed conflict, it was very challenging to work in the core districts directly affected such as Rukum, Rolpa, Salyan, Jajarkot and Dang. Understanding the importance of the child protection issues during the conflict and unfazed by the challenge, CWIN started working in the frontline in those districts for protecting children from the atrocities of armed conflict. Protection of children during the armed conflict; initiation of the first Child Helpline in Nepal in collaboration with the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare and the Nepal Telecom Authority; and initiating the first child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient department at Kanti Children's Hospital are some of the most important achievements by CWIN in the child rights field in Nepal. CWIN was inspired by the successful humanitarian services it could extend after the devastating earthquake of 2015 and has gained some confidence that local organisations can play a dynamic role in the delivery of humanitarian assistance in times of disaster as they understand local situations and are trusted by the community.</p>

<p>Children are the source of inspiration for CWIN to continue its journey with undaunted determination. The positive changes we have witnessed among children through different initiatives and programmes of CWIN have provided us with unwavering strength. In addition, the support we have received from various government line agencies, political parties, concerned stakeholders, international partners and communities are also sources of inspiration for CWIN. CWIN is truly humbled by the support and solidarity it has received from all concerned citizens, civil society actors and co-workers involved in the child rights and human rights movements. CWIN wishes to extend its sincere gratitude to all its well-wishers. We welcome the valuable inputs of our well-wishers and critics.</p></div>

         <p>CWIN is committed to taking forward the child rights movement to secure all necessary protections and supports maintaining its tradition of partnership with children. Through its advocacy work, it will continue to influence mainstream development programmes to be inclusive of children, to foster democracy with children. It will continue to influence political parties, government, policymakers and other responsible stakeholders to act upon their promises to ensure the rights of every child in the country and to translate the essence of the new constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. It will work intensively with the newly elected local governments and the new provincial structures to bring child rights into the mainstream agenda for national development. CWIN will continue to play the role of a watchdog and fight against all forms of child abuse and exploitation. CWIN will also continue its partnership with the children, for working in collaboration with federal, provincial and local governments, civil society and the private sector in all the seven provinces of Nepal for the promotion and protection of the rights of the children.</p>
