It facilitates Child Rights Forums by children for the rights of children. It also facilitates CWIN Street Theatre and CWIN Sports Club.</p>
                    <p>CWIN is working in 22 districts of Nepal through Child Rights Forums formed by the school children. CRFs are active in promoting overall rights of children including children's right to participation in the issues concerning children. The CRFs are also advocating for the issues of education in general and child labour. In eight of the 22 districts, CWIN's conscientisers work with the community initiatives to promote and protect child rights.</p>
