                        <p class="PT-3">CWINâ€™s helpline system entered a new phase with the installation of toll free number. The Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare, Nepal Telecom and the Nepal Telecommunications Corporation all jointly own the Child Helpline with its toll free number 1098. The helplines in Kathmandu, Biratnagar, Pokhara, Hetauda and Nepalgunj will now all have the same number and CWIN plans to expand the Child Helpline into other parts of the country.</p>
                    <p>CWIN also played an important role in developing regulations for running Child Helpline in collaboration with the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare.</p>
